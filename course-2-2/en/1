Dear Mr.Abrams:

With reference to your job advertisement in "SoftTech Innovations" of Sunday October 20 on LinkedIn, I would like to apply for the position of Senior IT Web Programmer in your company. I am writing to ask if there are any current vacancies in your team for someone with my background and skills.

I hold a vocational degree in Web Development and am currently pursuing a higher education in the same field. I have four years of commercial experience, for the past two years, I have worked in a large IT company focused on auctions, tenders, and government procurement systems.

Since my present position offers little prospect for advancement, I would prefer to be employed in an expanding organization such as yours. Currently, I am at present earning $1,600 per month, but I am looking for an opportunity to grow professionally in a company like yours. 

I have strong technical expertise in PHP, Symfony, Git, Vue.js, and Linux server administration.

I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Dmitriev Dmitry
