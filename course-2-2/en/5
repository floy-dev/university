Ref: Our Order No. 145 of October 15, 2024

Dear Mr.Abrams:

Thank you for your delivery of server equipment, which we ordered on October 15, 2024. At the same time, we wish to draw your attention to the following issues.

After examining the equipment, we discovered several problems:

 - 10 processors that do not meet the required specifications.
 - 5 hard drives arrived damaged.
 - 2 cooling systems were sent as different models.
We are returning the defective items separately and kindly ask you to replace them with properly functioning equipment.

We would appreciate a prompt response and hope for a quick resolution to this matter. We look forward to continuing our cooperation in the future.

Yours faithfully,
Dmitriev Dmitry
